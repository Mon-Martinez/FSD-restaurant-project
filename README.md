#Name: Responsive Restaurant Project 
#Usage: Display a menu for a fictional restaurant. This project was meant to highlight the HTML and CSS elements students had learned in the first section of the Hack the Gap "Full Stack Development" course. This restaunt menu also displays my ability to use Bootstrap Grid to implement responsive design. 
#Visuals: Please refere to the attached images to see what my project looked like before adjusting the code and css to include Bootstrap elements.
